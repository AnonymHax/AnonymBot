# AnonymBot

This is the old AnonymBot project, being a Dofus 2.0 socket bot, made by G0hu and me (AnonymHax)

Here are its features:

- Shops
- Fighting AI
- Scripts system for fights / trades
- Group system
- Follow
- Character / Spell Management
- Flood
- Exchange
- Group system
- Human response system (CleverBot)
- Bypass of anti-bot security (having changed since the end of the project)

Some features were still to explore and finish, but may help some in the implementation of their own bots

The project is divided into 3 parts:

AnonymBot: the bot made in C ++ / Qt with QML for the interface
SlaveMaker: The server in C ++ / Qt managing the premium / free subscriptions to use the bot (the bot is no longer marketed now), and managing exchanges with a client Dofus injected to bypass some anti-bot security (gone)
CodeGenerator: Automatic translator of source code protocols from the AS3 game to our own C ++ protocol

Before it stopped, the bot was re-designed in QML, although most of the features were complete, so the current interface is only a small part of its capabilities. Some old screenshots allow to glimpse all abilities.
